### üì£ We're looking for front-end development engineers interested in Knowledge QA with LLM, who can help us achieve front-end and back-end separation with our current implementation.

### Introduction
- Questions & Answers based on local knowledge base + LLM.
- Reason:
    - The idea of this project comes from [Langchain-Chatchat](https://github.com/chatchat-space/Langchain-Chatchat).
    - I have used this project before, but it is not very flexible and deployment is not very friendly.
    - Learn from the ideas in [How to build a knowledge question answering system with a large language model](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/movaNCWjJGBaes6KxhpYpg), and try to use this as a practice.
- Advantage:
    - The whole project is modularized and does not depend on the `lanchain` library, each part can be easily replaced, and the code is simple and easy to understand.
    - In addition to the large language model interface that needs to be deployed separately, other parts can use CPU.
    - Support documents in common formats, including `txt, md, pdf, docx, pptx, excel` etc. Of course, other types of documents can also be customized and supported.

### Demo
