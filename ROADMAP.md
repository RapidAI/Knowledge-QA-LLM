### Standard Evaluation Process

Before proceeding with feature development and strategy optimization, we need a standard evaluation process to ensure all the features and strategies we introduce are effective.

Create testsets using any dataset with advanced models and Ragas, then validate solution effectiveness using basic models.

### Feature Development and Strategy Optimization

1. BM25 Keyword Search
2. Hybrid Search (BM25 + Vector)
3. GraphRAG
4. ReRanking
5. Query Rewriting
6. Small-to-big
7. ...
